												<h3>Board Games</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Nothing stirs me up like a good board game. Whether it would be a luck based game
												like Catan or simply a tactical manuever game like Chess, I love sitting down and
												indulging within the board game sphere. Although board games seem to be an apparent 
												waste of time, one of my favorite board games, DUNE Imperium, has taught me skills
												I would not imagine learning from a board game. From learning persuasive tactics to 
												teaching strategy to others, DUNE Imperium, especially has honed my communication skills
												and tuned my abilities to make an impact within the DUNE community.

												<h3>Hiking</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Trees, forests, flowers, and overall nature relaxes me from the daily stress of responsibilities,
												so in my past time, I love going outside and feeling the breeze and exploring nature. One of my 
												favorite hobbbies is hiking, whether it would be alone or with friends/family. I am always open to 
												exploring new places and gaining new experiences. From my hikes, I have learned the importance of
												preparation and perseverence. Since some hikes can be extensive and dangerous, having the right gear
												for the occasion is key, whether it would be water or food supplies to keep you energized through the hike.

												<h3>Sports</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Throughout my life, I have always been raised to love cricket, as it has been ingrained within my family.
												From starting a team in my high school that went on to get a bronze medal to playing locally with friends,
												cricket has played an impactful role on me. From being the captain of my team, I learned management, allocation
												of resources (Using my players to their best abilities), and leadership. Furthermore, I was able to apply these 
												skills outside of the field and into my jobs, since leading a team is crucial across environments. My love of Sports
												is not limited to just cricket; at college, I have played intramural soccer and I am always up to date with Liverpool FC,
												my favorite soccer team. The skills I learnt while playing cricket were transferrable to soccer as well because 
												communication is one of the key abilities, when calling for the ball or initiating a signal for a pass.
