														<h3>International Dune Tournament</h3>
													</header>
													<p>One of my biggest accomplishments has been to be ranked <strong> TOP 4 </strong> in the world for a board game I hold very dear to me.
														Due to my excellence in the board game known as Dune Imperium, I was invited to a tournament where the top 36 players competed for tournament
														prize pot of <strong> $30,000 </strong>, held by Jimmy Donaldson, otherwise known as <strong>Mr.Beast</strong>. In this experience, I was able
														to network with some of the figures in the community, along with getting an opportunity to speak with the creator of the game, Paul Dennen, and 
														the Director of <strong> Dire Wolf Digital</strong>, Scott Martins. Although most of the competition revolved around the board game, there were several 
														opportunities for me to talk to Mr. Dennen and Mr. Martins about their roles in the creation of the game, as I was curious to know what went on
														behind the scenes for them to design this amazing board game.
